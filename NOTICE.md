This is an experimental fork for me to learn from https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf.

I have modified all of the .py files to accomodate a new data set and add some new functionality. This repository is not maintained.
Please use the orginal repository at https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf.
